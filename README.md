brightness_test.py
1. Edit the path of the cv2.imread() function to choose the image to apply the variation on.
2. Set the brightness constant in the value variable
3. Run the script - python brightness_test.py

contrast_test.py
1. Edit the path of the cv2.imread() function to choose the image to apply the variation on.
2. Set the array_alpha value to control to contrast
3. Run the script - python contrast_test.py

saturation_test.py
1. Edit the path of the cv2.imread() function to choose the image to apply the variation on.
2. Choose the enhancement value (>1 for positive saturation and <1 for negative saturation)
3. Run the script - python saturation_test.py
